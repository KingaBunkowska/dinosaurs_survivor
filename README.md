# About the project
It is a simple game developed for the Python Programming course at AGH University during the 2023/2024 academic year. The project focuses on applying object-oriented programming principles and using Python features in practice. 

We are not graphic designers, so the visuals are quite basic.

The game was inspired by *Vampire Survivor*. The main goal is to survive the attack of a hoard of dinosaurs and a boss fight.

## Key Features 
- **Weapons and Abilities:** Players can use different weapons and special abilities to battle dinosaurs.
- **Character Leveling:** As players gather experience points, they can level their character, improving stats and upgrading their weapon.
- **Shop System:** Before each game, players can spend their in-game currency on upgrades, enhancing their combat effectiveness.
- **Dinosaur Allies:** Occasionally, defeated dinosaurs drop eggs. If collected, these eggs hatch into a random dinosaur that aids the player in battle.
- **Boss Fight:** After surviving for a certain period, a boss, the mighty Polonozuch, appears. This large dinosaur has its own set of special abilities.
- **Resource Collection:** Players can gather bushes to restore health or recharge certain abilities.
